### Running examples

**Note:** The examples are not starters - the dependencies are set up to work
locally within this repo. They can be adapted for standalone use, but are
intentionally not set up for it.

1. Clone or fork the repo
2. Install root dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the component build watch task (keep this running)

```bash
npm run watch
```

4. In a separate terminal, install example dependencies

```bash
cd examples/<example-name>
npm install
```

5. Initialize the database

```bash
npx convex dev --once
```

6. Run the example

```bash
npm run dev
```
