import { defineApp } from "convex/server";
import betterAuth from "@erquhart/convex-better-auth/convex.config";

const app = defineApp();
app.use(betterAuth);

export default app;
```

Set up your auth instance and register routes (see docs for details):

```ts
// convex/auth.ts
import { BetterAuth } from "@erquhart/convex-better-auth";

export const betterAuth = new BetterAuth(components.betterAuth, {
  /* options */
});
